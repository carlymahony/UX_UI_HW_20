              We performed user interviews in the research phase of our design process to learn more about what our users look for when deciding upon a nonprofit to support.  A few key insights that we pulled out of these interviews were: 
              <ul>1. Our users are interested in participating and anf learning more about charity event</ul>
              <ul>2. Our users typically donate around the holiday and typically make an annual contribution</ul>
              <ul>3. Our users are most interested in nonprofits that help children and teens.</ul>
